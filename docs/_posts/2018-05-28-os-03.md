### Reference: 
Udacity's [Introduction to Operating System](https://classroom.udacity.com/courses/ud923)

### CPU Scheduler
* decides how and when processes and threads access shared CPU
* schedules tasks running user level processes and threads and kernel level threads
* chooses one of the ready tasks from ready queue to run on CPU
* runs when 
    * CPU is idle
    * new task become ready
    * timeslice expired 
    
### Which task from ready queue to be selected?
* depends on 
    * scheduling policy and algorithm
    * design and data structure of the `run queue`

### Run to completion scheduling
* Based on first come first serve
    * Average completion time and wait time goes higher if one long task gets in front of smaller tasks
* Shortest Job First
    * Improves average completion and wait time
    * RunQueue, cannont be a simple queue, it could be implemented as a balanced tree data structure

### Preemptive Scheduling
* SJF
    * starts as FCFS
    * when a shorter job enters the queue, the current job is preempted and the shorter job is executed
* Priority Scheduling
    * tasks have different priority
    * run highest priority task next 
    * avg. wait time and execution time will be impacted if a long running task has higher priority
    * `starvation:` low priority tasks are stuck in the run queue
    * `priority aging:` prevents starvation by increasing the priority of a task by the time spent on the RunQueue
* Priority Inversion
    * when a tasks acquires a lock, its priority is boosted temporarily so it can release the lock.

### Round robin scheduling
* `Timeslice:` Each task is given some time unit to execute on the CPU, after which it is preempted and other tasks are executed similarly in a roundrobin manner
* Does not require complex RunQueue data structures, like in the case of SJF, but produces similar metrics like SJF
* I/O operations can happen during wait states
* Context switching overheads will have impacts on the metrics
* `Length of timeslice:`
    * CPU bound tasks, 
        * higher the length of timeslice is better. 
        * The avg wait will be higher but that does not matter, the execution time matters. 
        * Longer timeslice, lesser context switching.
        * makes the system look responsive.
    * I/O based 
        * shorter timeslices are better
        * I/O bound tasks needs to yield for I/O activities
        * keeps CPU and device utilization high
        * better user perceived performance

### RunQueue Data Structure
* Simple Queue
* Priority Queues
* Trees
* Multi queue data structure for different levels of CPU and I/O intensive tasks
* Linux CFS - Completely Fair Scheduler uses a Red Black Tree to for RunQueue Data Structure

### Memory Management
* Enables multiple applications to share the physical memory. 
* Physical memory is abstracted by virtual memory. Virtual address space can be much larger than the physical address space

### Memory management goals
* Not impose any size restrictions due to multiple applications sharing the memory
* `Allocate:` Allocate space in physical memory for the virtual address space. replace/swap data to and from disk
* `Arbitration:` Address translations and validation

### Page based memory management
* Virtual address space is divided into `fixed size pages` and physical memory is divided into `page frames` of the same size.
* Allocation maps virtual pages to physical page frames 
* For Arbitration the entries are maintained on the `page table`

### Segment Based Memory Management
* Uses flexibly sized `segments` for allocation and `segment tables` for arbitration


### Inter-process communication
* message Passing
    * sockets
    * pipes
    * message queues
* Memory based
    * shared memory
    * mem-mapped files
    
### Goal
To transfer data from the address space of one process to the address space of another

### Comparison between the different types of IPC

|copy|map|
|---|---|
|Sockets, pipes and queues | shared memory and files|
|Copied data to a channel on the kernal | OS creates a shared address space between the 2 processes|
|Needs CPU cycles to copy data to and from the ports to the channel | Needs CPU cycles to map address spaces and to copy data to the channel|
| | The shared memory needs to be synchronized because both the processes have access to the shared memory|
| not efficient for large data copy or multiple msg transfer | Set up one and use manu times. also useful for one time large messages|

### Limitations of Mutex and condition variables
1. Error prone
2. Lack of ease of use
3. Lack of expressiveness

### Spinlocks
* Similar to mutex
* only difference is, when a thread is blocked on a mutex, its execution on the CPU is suspended and goes back to the waiting state until it is unblocked.
* whereas, in spinlock the thread continues to hold on to its CPU timeslice and burns cycles, until its CPU cycle expires or it is unlocked.

### Semaphore
* Acts like a traffic signal
* Provides count based synchronization for usecases when max of 5 producers can perform the operation
* A semapohre with max count 1 is equivalent to mutex 

### Semaphore API
```angular2html
sem_init(Semaphore, count)
sem_wait(Semaphore)
sem_post(Semaphore)
```   
* `init:` assigns count, max value to the semaphore
* `wait:` if semaphore is non-zero, decrements and proceeds
* `post:` increments

# Other synchronization constructs
1. reader writer locks
2. monitors - higher level sync constructs.  

### I/O Device Features

* Control Registers - The CPU controls these registers
    * Command
    * Data Transfers
    * Status
* Micro Controllers - Device's CPU
* On device memory
* Other logic

### PCI Bus
* Peripheral Component Interconnect Bus

### Types of devices
* Block
* Character
* Network

### Performance Metrics
Any quantifiable property of a system that can be used to evaluate the system's behavior
* Execution Time
* Throughput - How many tasks will be completed over a period of time
* Average resource usage
* Platform efficiency - How well the resources are utilized to deliver the throughput
* Cost - performance per dollar
* Energy consumption - performance per watt
* Percentage of SLA violation
* Response time
* CPU Utilization
* Wait time - when the job will start?
* client perceived performance
* aggregate performance of multiple systems
