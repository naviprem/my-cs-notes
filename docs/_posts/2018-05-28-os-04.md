### Virtualization
* Multiple Operating Systems can be deployed on the same hardware platform
* Each Operating System along with its applications and its virtual resources is known as `virtual machine`
* `hypervisor or Virtual Machine Monitor (VMM):` Is the virtualization layer that abstracts and manages the physical hardware (Memory, CPU, Disk and NIC)

### RPC Remote Procedure Call
* simplify the development of cross address scpace and cross machine interactions

### RPC Requirements
* Client/Server Interactions
* API
* Type checking
* Cross-Machine Conversion
* Different types of protocols

### DFS Distributed File System
* File server distributed on multiple machines
    * `Replicated:` each server has all the files - good for resiliency
    * `Partisioned:` each server stores part of the file system - good for scalability
    * `Combination:` files are partitioned and independently replicated on different servers
