Udacity's [JavaScript and the DOM](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-and-the-dom--ud117)

### DOM - Document Object Model

* DOM is the full parsed representation of the HTML markup
* HTML specification has a set of rules on how browsers parse and process the html data to paint the web page
* Tree structure that captures the content, structure and properties of the html and all the relationships between the nodes

### DOM Interfaces

* `EventTarget` is an interface implemented by objects that can receive events and may have listeners for them.
* `Node` is an interface from which a number of DOM API object types inherit.
* The `Document` interface represents any web page loaded in the browser and serves as an entry point into the web page's content, which is the DOM tree.
* `Element` is the most general base class from which all objects in a Document inherit. It only has methods and properties common to all kinds of elements. More specific classes inherit from Element.
