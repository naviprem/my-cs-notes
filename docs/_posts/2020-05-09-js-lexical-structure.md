# JS Lexical Structure

Notes from *Javascript Defenitive Guide* Link [here] (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B004XQX4K0/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1)

- Lexical Structure = elementary rules, lowest-level syntax

## Case Sensitivity

- JS is case sensitive whereas HTML is not. Many clientside JS objects and properties ahve the same name as HTML tags and elements. These names typically is all lower case. For example: `onclick`

## Identifiers

- In JS, identifiers are used to name variables, functions and label loops
- Identifier can start with a letter, underscore or doller sign
- Followed by letters, digits, underscore and dollar sign
- JS allows identifers from the entire unicode character set this allowed to name variable in other languages and math symbols like Pi
- However, due to portaility and ease of editing, it is common to use only ASCII letters and digits.
- Js keywords and global variable are reserved and should not be used as variables
