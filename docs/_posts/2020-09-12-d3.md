## D3 Scales

### Abstract Dimension

- Represents the domain
- There are 2 types:
- Quantitative: measurable quantifiable numbers.
- Nominal: names, identifiers

### Visual Variable

- x
- y
- z

### Scale

- Each scale is configured by pairwise correspondences from abstract data (the domain) to visual variable (the range). For example, the x-domain’s lower value (0) is mapped to x-range’s lower value (the chart’s left edge), while the domain’s upper value (the maximum count) is mapped to the range’s upper value (the right edge).

#### Linear Scale

- the domain and range are continuous intervals (from min to max).
  
#### Band Scale

- the domain is an array of discrete values while the range is a continuous interval; the band scale automatically determines how to slice the range into discrete, padded bands.
