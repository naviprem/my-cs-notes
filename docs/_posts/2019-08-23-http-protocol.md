HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol

- Underlying protocol used by `World Wide Web`
- Client server protocol.
- The messages sent by the client, usually a Web browser, are called requests and the messages sent by the server as an answer are called responses.
- `Http Client:` user-agent is any tool that acts on the behalf of the user. This role is primarily performed by the Web browser; other possibilities are programs used by engineers and Web developers to debug their applications.
- `Http Server:` serves the document as requested by the client. A server is not necessarily a single machine, but several server software instances can be hosted on the same machine. With HTTP/1.1 and the Host header, they may even share the same IP address.
- `Http Proxy:` 



HTTPS - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure

- It is the secure version of HTTP where the messages between browsers and web servers are encrypted
