Notes from *[Mastering Regular Expression](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Regular-Expressions-Jeffrey-Friedl/dp/0596528124/)* - author *Jeffrey E. F. Friedl*

## Starting and ending of a line
- `^` - Start of line
- `$` - End of line

## Character Class

- `[...]` - Character class. 
  - `gr[ea]y` finds both *grey* and *gray*
  - `<h[123456]>` finds all `<h>` tags
- Use `-` to specify range of characters.
- `-` is a meta character only within character class
  - `<h[1-6]>` finds all `<h>` tags
- Can include multiple ranges
  - `[A-Fa-f0-9]` matches hexa decimal numbers
- Can combine ranges with literals
  - `[0-9A-Z_!.?]`
- `[^...]` - negated character class
  - `[^1-6]` matches a character that’s not 1 through 6
- `-` and `^` are the only meta character in a character class.
- Other regualr expression metacharacters like `?` and `.` are not meta characters within character class
- `03[-./]l9[-./]76` - In this example, `-` is not a meta character within the character class, because it immediately follows the `[` opening bracket of the character class.

## Matching Any Character with Dot

- `.` - matches any character
- `03.19.76` - matches the date in different formats. It is a little vague but easier to read than the specific expression `03[-./]l9[-./]76`

## Matching any one of several subexpressions

- `|` - Combine multiple expressions (alternatives) into single expression that matches any one of the sub expressions
  - `Bob|Robert` - matches `Bob` or `Robert`.
  - `grey|gray` and `gr(a|e)y` are valid
  - `gr[a|e]y` is not valid, because `|` is not a meta character within character class
  - `(Fir|1)st.[Ss]treet` matches *first street*
  - `^(From|Subject|Date):.` - matches any line that starts with `From:` or `Subject:` or `Date:`

## Ignoring Differences in Capitalization

- `i` - option to perform case-insensitive search
- This option is not part of regular expression. But many tools and languages provide this option
- In javascript use `i` option as `/ab+c/i`

## Word Boundaries
`\b` - start-of-word or end-of-word position
    - `'asdas catfdd cat sdjcat'.match(/\bcat/g)` prints `['cat', 'cat']`

## Optional Items

- `?` - means optional
  - `(July|Jul)•(fourth|4th|4)` can be writtend as `July?•(fourth|4(th)?)`

## Other Quantifiers

- `+` - one or more of the immediately-preceding item
- `*` - any number, including none, of the item
  - `<H[1-6] *>` matches `<h1 >` as well as `<h2  >`

## Uses of Parentheses

- limit the scope of alternation `gr(e|a)y`
- apply quantifiers to group of characters `4(th)?`

## Backreferencing

- allows you to match new text that is the same as some text matched earlier in the expression
- parentheses can “remember” text matched by the subexpression they enclose
  - `([a-z])([0-9])\1\2` - the `\1` refers to the text matched by `[a-z]`, and `\2` refers to the text matched by `[0-9]`

## Escape

- when a metacharacter is escaped, it loses its special meaning and becomes a literal character
- `c1\.com` matches c1.com

## Useful shorthands (language/tool specific)

`\t` - a tab character

`\n` - a newline character

`\r` - a carriage-return character

`\s` - matches any “whitespace” character (space, tab, newline, formfeed, and such)

`\S` - anything not `\s`

`\w` - `[a-zA-Z0-9_]` (useful as in `\w+`, ostensibly to match a word)

`\W` - anything not `\w`, i.e., `[^a-zA-Z0-9_]`

`\d` - `[0-9]`, i.e., a digit

`\D` - anything not `\d`, i.e., `[^0-9]`
